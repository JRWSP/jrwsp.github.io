Hallo! Ciao! Hi! สวัสดี! 

I am a theoretical quantum physicist and postdoctoral researcher from Thailand, currently based in Germany, specializing in tensor network simulations and quantum metrology.
I recently completed my Ph.D. on simulating strongly interacting NV-center ensembles using Matrix Product States and Density Operators.
I will soon be starting a new postdoctoral position in Italy.
My research interests also include quantum computing, numerical optimization, and quantitative finance.

I enjoy diving🤿, hiking🥾, coding💻, and drinking🍺

I am a cat person 🐈

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
