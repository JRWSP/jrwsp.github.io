    - title: Ph.D.
      institution: Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany
      year: 2025
      description:
        - Developed tensor network simulations of strongly interacting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond.
        - Explored the limitations in simulating the dynamics of NV clusters under interaction, disorder, and dissipation.
        - Investigated quantum fisher information and entanglement generation, and achieved highly sensitive probe states composed of collective spins using optimal control methods.
    - title: M.Sc.
      institution: Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand
      year: 2021
      description:
        - Conducted research on Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) using IBM’s Qiskit.
        - Evaluated the QAOA’s potential in solving clustering problems.
        - Benchmarked performance against the classical K-means clustering algorithm
    - title: B.Sc.
      institution: Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand
      year: 2019
      description:
        - Conducted research on decoherence suppression in a single qubit by quantum delayed feedback based on the no-knowledge measurement.
        - Analytically derived compatible results between the Itô and Stratonovich stochastic master equations.
        - rovided analytical solutions for delayed feedback where the measurement operator commutes with a unitary operator, supplemented by numerical results for the general case.
